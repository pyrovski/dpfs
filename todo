- Implement monitor client
  - Get OSDs and MDSs from monitor

- Implement monitor
  - Track OSDs, MDSs, monitors

- Finish implementing event-driven MonManager. Manager should support
  functionality previously exposed by MonClient and simultaneously
  manage a set of MonClients.

- Finish converting MonClient class to event-driven
  implementation. All MonClients should be part of a MonManager.

- Consider generalizing MonManager into ClientManager, a class that
  supports server failover.

- Generalize MonClient into Client class, and class that implements
  event-driven communication with servers.

- Add debug levels to log
